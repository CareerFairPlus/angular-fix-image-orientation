This is, however, just a **visual** fix.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    <img img-fix-orientation=\"imageUrl\" ng-src=\"{{ imageUrl }}\">\r\n\r\n> Note: Currently, only URL and data-url (i.e. `data:image/jpeg...`) image sources are accepted. Feel free to send PRs to support more image sources.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install via Bower, downloading the source, or outright copy-pasting. For the latter 2, you'll also have to manually install [EXIF-JS](https://github.com/jseidelin/exif-js). The preferred way to install, however, is with Bower:\r\n\r\n    bower install czarpino/angular-fix-image-orientation --save\r\n\r\nInclude js file in your HTML below AngularJS and EXIF-JS (yes, also include `exif.js`):\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/exif-js/exif.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/angular/angular.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/angular-fix-image-orientation/angular-fix-image-orientation.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nAnd don't forget to include as module dependency:\r\n\r\n    angular.module(\"appModule\", ['cp.ng.fix-image-orientation']);\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-42612487-01","note":"Don't delete this file!
